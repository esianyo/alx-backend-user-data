# Personal Data Filter

## Description
Personal Data Filter is a Python module designed to obfuscate sensitive information in log messages. It provides a function `filter_datum` that takes a list of fields to obfuscate, a redaction string, the log message, and a separator string. It uses regular expressions to replace occurrences of certain field values with the redaction string.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/personal-data-filter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd personal-data-filter
   ```

## Usage
You can use the `filter_datum` function in your Python code to obfuscate sensitive information in log messages. Here's how to use it:

```python
from filtered_logger import filter_datum

fields = ["password", "date_of_birth"]
message = "name=John;email=john@example.com;password=secretpassword;date_of_birth=01/01/1990;"
separator = ";"

obfuscated_message = filter_datum(fields, 'xxx', message, separator)
print(obfuscated_message)
```

This will obfuscate the password and date_of_birth fields in the log message.

## Testing
To run the unit tests for the module, use the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
