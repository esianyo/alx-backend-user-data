# Basic Authentication API

## Description
This project implements a basic authentication system for an API using Python and Flask. It includes functionality for handling user authentication, error handling for unauthorized and forbidden requests, and securing routes that require authentication.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/basic-authentication-api.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd basic-authentication-api
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Set up and start the server:
   ```
   API_HOST=0.0.0.0 API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app
   ```
2. Use the API endpoints with tools like cURL or a web browser.

## Endpoints
- `/api/v1/status`: GET - Returns the status of the API.
- `/api/v1/unauthorized`: GET - Simulates an unauthorized request.
- `/api/v1/forbidden`: GET - Simulates a forbidden request.
- Other endpoints may require authentication, depending on the authentication method used.

## Authentication
The project supports basic authentication. You can set the authentication type by using the `AUTH_TYPE` environment variable. Available options are `auth` and `basic_auth`.

### Basic Authentication
To use basic authentication, set `AUTH_TYPE=basic_auth` in the environment variables. You can then access protected routes by providing a valid username and password in the Authorization header.

Example:
```
curl -H "Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>" http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/users
```

## Testing
You can test the endpoints using cURL or any HTTP client. Unit tests for the authentication classes are also provided.

To run unit tests:
```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
